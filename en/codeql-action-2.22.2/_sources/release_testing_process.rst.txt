Release testing process
=======================

We run the following before a release:

Windows x86 host
----------------

::

   run_tests.bat

Linux x86 host
--------------

Clang, GCC; Arm, PPC cross-compile: ``./run_tests.sh``

Manual test of WASM and WASM_EMU256 targets.

Check libjxl build actions at
https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/2269. (As of 2025-08-14 this is
currently paused and requires a token update)

Version updates
---------------

Prepend to debian/changelog and update mentions of the current version
in:

-  base.h
-  CMakeLists.txt
-  MODULE.bazel
-  g3doc/faq.md

Signing the release
-------------------

-  ``git archive --prefix=highway-X.Y.Z/ -o highway-X.Y.Z.tar.gz X.Y.Z``
-  ``gpg --armor --detach-sign highway-X.Y.Z.tar.gz``
-  Edit release and attach the resulting ``highway-X.Y.Z.tar.gz.asc``
