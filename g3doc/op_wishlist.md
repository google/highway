## Wishlist

### Vector tuple type

Vec2, Create/Get functions, add second Load/StoreInterleaved interface.

### 52x52=104-bit multiply

For crypto. Native on Icelake+.

### Slide1Up/Down

Potentially useful for comparing neighbors e.g. for RLE.

### RVV codegen

*   `rgather_vx` for broadcasting redsum result?
*   Fix remaining 8-bit table lookups for large vectors (`Broadcast`,
    `Interleave`, `LoadDup128`): use 64-bit for initial shuffle. For
    `TwoTablesLookupLanes`, use 16-bit indices.

### SVE codegen
* SVE2: use XAR for `RotateRight`
* `CombineShiftRightBytes` use `TableLookupLanes` instead?
* `Shuffle*`: use `TableLookupLanes` instead?
* Use SME once available: DUP predicate, REVD (rotate 128-bit elements by 64),
  SCLAMP/UCLAMP, 128-bit TRN/UZP/ZIP (also in F64MM)

### emu128 codegen
* `#pragma unroll(1)` in all loops to enable autovectorization

### Add emu256 target
Reuse same wasm256 file, `#if` for wasm-specific parts. Use reserved avx slot.

### Extend contrib/algo
* Reduce
* Min/Max/IdxMin
* CountIf (https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/simd/masking/)

### `SumOfLanes` returning scalar
Avoids extra broadcast.

### Reductions for 8-bit
For orthogonality; already done for x86+NEON.

### Clear lowest mask bit
For iterating in hash table.

### Conflict detection
For hash tables. Use VPCONFLICT on ZEN4.

### `PromoteToEven`
For `WidenMul`, `MinOfLanes`.

### `PromoteTo` for all types
For orthogonality.

### Add `DupEven` for 16-bit
Use in `MinOfLanes` (helps NEON).

### Masked add/sub
For tolower (subtract if in range) or hash table probing.

### `AddSub`
Interval arithmetic?

### `Dup128TableLookupBytes`
Avoids having to add offset on RVV. Table must come from `LoadDup128`.

### `LoadPromoteTo`
For SVE (svld1sb_u32)+WASM? Compiler can probably already fuse.
